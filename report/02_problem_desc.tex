\section{Problem Description}

Simplesite changed their subscription service to a so called freemium model
during 2015. This model means that everyone can have a website for free, and it
will never be closed. This way of doing subscriptions means that more people
sign up, and become potential customers, however a trend is that most customers
that sign up either don't become paying customers, or simple make a site and
stop using it after a few days.

Simplesite wishes to map the life-cycle of customers in an attempt to find out
how paying (good) users use their site, as well as look at the life-cycles of
the many free or abandoned customers. They hope to discover what, if any, the
significant differences is in the different lifecycles. The goal is to attempt
to guide new customers down the paths that are known to be ``good'' and hopefully
detect if customers are stuck or have forgotten about their website.

\subsection{Requirements}
\todo[inline]{This is garbage, fix it.}
Simplesite have already started working on creating datasets and attempting to
map variables. In order work with their existing code I was given access to a
code repository which I can commit to.

The existing code is written in R\footnote{\url{https://www.r-project.org/}} and
as such, the code I will be producing will also be written in R. Furthermore, in
order to easy human understanding of the data models worked out, decision trees
(and related machinelearning models) was chosen as the model. Decision trees,
once constructed offer an intuitive way to look at what parameters lead to
different outcomes. They also closely resemble a number of customer life-cycles
combined into a graph.
