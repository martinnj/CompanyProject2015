\section{Introduction}

During this project I work with the Danish website/hosting company Simplesite
ApS\footnote{\url{http://www.simplesite.com}} to help analyze user behaviour.
This analysis is done through the collection of behavioral data from a base of
existing customers and creating decision tree models based on this data.
Different types of decision trees and parameters was created and tested to find
the configuration that yields the best results and will allow Simplesite to gain
the best posbbile understanding about their customers behvaviours.

The report starts with information about Simplesite as a company as well as
their product. It then goes on to describe the business problem that I want to
solve. After the problem is described, the analysis section shows the Cross
Industry Standard Process for Data Mining\cite{shearer2000crisp} (CRISP-DM).
This process guides the entire process of understanding the business problem to
preparing data, creating models and evaluating and deploying the knowledge or
models acquired from the project.

In the end of the report I go over the results of the experiments and outline
som possible work to improve these results. I also reflect on how some of the
skills acquired at DIKU fit into the project as well as what new knowledge I
have acquired.

The source-code files from the project can be obtained by emailing me (see
frontpage for contact details).
