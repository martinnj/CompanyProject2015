\subsection{Data Understanding}


The data understanding phase of data science is the second phase. During this
phase you look into what data is available and collect whatever information
might be relevant for the data science problem. During this phase you will also
identify data quality problems and gain familiarity with the data in order to
help form a better hypothesis. It is worth noting that weaknesses in the dataset
are not removed until the next phase, data preparation, so in order to make the
report more readable, any arguments for removal or change will be listed in
Section \ref{sec:datasetpruning} instead of here.

The basis for the analysis is 2 datasets created by Simplesite:
\texttt{EngagementData} \& \texttt{CustomerJourney}. Table
\ref{tab:engdatalayout} and Table \ref{tab:cjdatalayout} names the features of
each dataset and what they represent. Both datasets contain users created
between September 1st 2015 and September 30 2015. The data is recorded for all
users after this point as well, but the larger dataset also increases memory
consumption, and makes it unwieldy. The training datasets both contain $463716$
observations, each corresponding to a user created in this timespan.

Another copy of each dataset was created from the database pulling data from
users created between October 1st 2015 and October 30 2015. These datasets
contains $495390$ observations and will be used as test data.
