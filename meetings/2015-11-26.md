 Customers have a journey:
  - A number of states of activation
  - Engagement should grow over time/states
  - What is engagement?

  Retention =  "They log in, and don't really stop."
  Conversion = "Do they start to pay, and maybe keep paying?"

Important, main project:
  - What creates engagement?
  - What creates retention?

  - Can we make a sensible life cycle for a customer?
    Example: LinkedIns profile builder.
