## Report feedback

-   How was the process and working with the company.

-   How did I solve the success criteria.

-   How can the knowledge gained from the trees be used.

-   "Cross validation is not strictly needed" - Well it is best practice maybe, so we should do it?

- X Before problem analysis: Describe the datamining process.

-   Look at the business problem, how do we work with that in data science.

-   False positives could mean you push away customers that would be good customers otherwise.

-   What is data science and how should we apply it here.

-   Explaion what decision trees are and when they're usefull, what could you use instead for other problems?

-   In chapter 4 (03_analysis) describe the data science process, it is in chapter 1-2 of the book.

-   Maybe work in a "textbook example" of how the trees aare being build.

- X For skills, maybe find something more concrete/lower levels, feature engineering etc etc?

- X Drop the table with the skills, it's very subjective, so a table won't be needed.

-   Can we write something about what Simplesite expected from the datatables? Did it match what we could do?
