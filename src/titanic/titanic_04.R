# The tree fitting can be controlled using this call instead:
#fit <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked,
#             data=train,
#             method="class",
#             control=rpart.control( your controls ))
# Where "your controls" can be set with the attributes found with
#?rport.control

# We can plot the decision tree to get a better grip of the model.
fancyRpartPlot(fit)

# But let's actually predict something!
Prediction <- predict(fit, test, type = "class")

# Save needed data to a file.
