# Inspecting the titles with 'table(combi$Title)' reveals that some titles are
# very unique and not likely to give us any good data, they most likely will
# result in highly specialised rules and overfitting, let's combine some that
# makes sense. Even if it might have offended those that held the titles. :)

# We can also attempt to combine SibSb and Parch into FamilySize, maybe mom and

# To avoid greating ID's for people travelling alone or just with one companion
# we create a 'small' ID as well.

# Lets fit a decision tree.
